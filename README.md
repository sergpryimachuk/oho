Oho is a weather app, built in SwiftUI and using the Open Weather Map API. Basically, a clone of [The Fucking Weather app](https://alcohollick.com/tfw) but in Ukrainian and with some _cancel culture_ context. 

You see, there was a lot of canceling lately. Some of it, maybe, was deserved. But often it's just blind, caused by little understanding and unwillingness to listen. This app is an illustration of it. Occasionally, what seems negative to us is often because we haven't looked at it well enough. So here I use some linguistic tricks, if I can call it that way, to show how the whole sense can be interpreted differently only with three characters - `***`.

In Ukrainian, the word weather is `погода` and the word pussy is `пизда`. These words have the same prefixes and endings. But placing `***` in the middle makes it difficult to recognise one from another - `п***да ? п***да`. So seeing a weather forecast like “the weather will be hot - погода буде жаркою”, with three asterisks makes the sense of the phrase, a little, different. A user needs to click `*ого` button to reveal the true meaning. 

Yeah, weird, but this is the way how I want to show the ambiguity in communication and the importance of looking up what’s behind the asterisks.

*this app was rejected by Apple. No wonder...
